## Why This Matters

Burnout is an increasingly recognized issue that affects individuals in various professions, especially in high-stress environments. The **Burnout Weight App** aims to provide a tool for individuals to gauge their burnout levels, empowering them to take steps toward better self-care and well-being. By understanding the signs and risks associated with burnout, users can seek early intervention and make informed decisions about their mental health.

This tool is particularly important as it allows users to assess their condition privately and anonymously, which can reduce stigma and encourage more people to seek help. For organizations, it offers a way to monitor workforce wellness and prevent burnout before it leads to more severe consequences.

2. **Analysis**: The app analyzes the provided information using predefined algorithms to assess burnout levels.
3. **Results & Recommendations**: The app displays a burnout score, along with personalized recommendations for reducing burnout risk.

The app is highly interactive, providing real-time feedback as users adjust their inputs, making it an excellent tool for both self-assessment and awareness.

## Code

The code for the app is available below, showcasing the main components of the application:

```r
library(shiny)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

# UI
ui <- fluidPage(
  titlePanel("Burnout Weight App"),
  sidebarLayout(
    sidebarPanel(
      numericInput("workStress", "Work Stress Level (1-10)", 5, min = 1, max = 10),
      numericInput("personalStress", "Personal Stress Level (1-10)", 4, min = 1, max = 10),
      numericInput("workLifeBalance", "Work-Life Balance (1-10)", 6, min = 1, max = 10)
    ),
    mainPanel(
      plotOutput("burnoutPlot"),
      textOutput("burnoutScore"),
      textOutput("recommendation")
    )
  )
)

# Server Logic
server <- function(input, output) {
  
  burnoutScore <- reactive({
    score <- (input$workStress + input$personalStress) / 2
    return(score)
  })
  
  output$burnoutScore <- renderText({
    paste("Your Burnout Score: ", burnoutScore())
  })
  
  output$burnoutPlot <- renderPlot({
    ggplot(data.frame(x = 1:10, y = runif(10, 1, 10)), aes(x, y)) + geom_point()
  })
  
  output$recommendation <- renderText({
    if (burnoutScore() > 7) {
      return("High burnout risk! Consider seeking professional help.")
    } else {
      return("Moderate burnout risk. Consider lifestyle adjustments.")
    }
  })
}

# Run the app
shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
```
